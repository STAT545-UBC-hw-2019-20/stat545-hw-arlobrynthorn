# Introduction 
I am a second-year graduate student studying in the Stream and Riparian Research Lab with Dr. John Richardson. I hope to determine the ecological impacts of different forest management strategies on headwater riparian plant communities through the assessment of 6 plant functional traits. I grew up on Salt Spring Island, completed my undergrad at UBC, and have worked various jobs under the umbrella of Forestry since 2012.

## FUN FACTS!
I recently read something important about this assignment:
> "Include at least five markdown features in your README"   
> -Vincenzo [(here)](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/hw01/hw01/)

<s>I beleive</s> I have followed that instruction carefully (although, why won't tildes make my strikethrough work here?!)
